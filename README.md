# MakeMusiCpp

## Scope of project
The output will be in the form of a command line interface. It will be about music and music theory. For example, it should cover the following functionality:
- Display information about a note or chord
- Apply transformations to notes or chords
- Work with sequences of notes (scales) and chords (progressions)
- Let user specify settings such as musical temprament
- Output in different formats such as text or audio files

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is about learning. Being able to code something requires a certain level of understanding. Coding it is to some extent a way of proving to yourself and others that you understand something. I will want to learn about different tools, technologies and subjects
- I wish to learn about how to effectively use Visual Studio Code
- I want to gain a better understanding of compiling and building a project
- I want to make use of CMake
- I want to learn about music theory in general

## Resources
In this section I wish to keep track of all the resources I have read, watched and studied to be able to undertake this project.
